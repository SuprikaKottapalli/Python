OOPS: object-oriented programming
it is a bottom-up approach used to increase the productivity 
it increases the code reusability
more security
complex application development
features:
1) class = blueprint
2)object = instance of class
2)encapsulation = binding data members and member function as a single unit
5)polymorphism = many forms
6)inheritance = acquiring properties and features from another class

-class is defined with the 'class' keyword
-class can contain variables and method
var can be private, protected, instance, static, class method
class may contain body/pass when no body
there are types of methods like spl and normal method 
SPL meth is defined with prefix and suffixed with "__"(double underscore) eg: __abcd__(..)
spl methods are invoked automatically at the time of object creation i.e. __init__(self)
